# StepMark V0.2.0 - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Requirements Description

### Background

- **Business Problem**: V0.1.0 has shipped, but the core annotation flow still has several visual and interaction issues that make the tool feel less polished than Snipaste. V0.2.0 should focus on fixing these defects and adding practical style customization.
- **Target Users**: Windows users who create screenshot feedback for product review, implementation acceptance, and daily issue reporting.
- **Value Proposition**: Make StepMark's annotation output cleaner, make smart annotation feel more natural, and let users persist their preferred visual style across sessions.

### Feature Overview

- **Core Features**:
  - Remove unwanted light-blue shadow/glow from smart note, rectangle, and arrow annotations.
  - Improve smart note label placement when the arrow endpoint is on the left side.
  - Change smart note arrow start logic from nearest rectangle corner to nearest point on the shape boundary.
  - Allow the screenshot crop region to be adjusted inside the editor, including expanding outward beyond the initially selected region.
  - Add persistent per-tool style settings for color, stroke width, shape, line style, arrow head size, font size, and font family.
  - Add Snipaste-style secondary option panel under the toolbar for the selected tool.
- **Feature Boundaries**:
  - Included: smart note, rectangle, arrow, and text style customization.
  - Included: editor-stage crop adjustment based on the original full-screen capture.
  - Included: rectangular and elliptical shape modes for smart note boundary and rectangle tool.
  - Included: solid and dashed arrow modes, plus arrow head size adjustment.
  - Excluded: AI analysis, issue-list markdown export, cloud sync, multi-profile style presets, and advanced shape libraries.
- **User Scenarios**:
  - A user captures a region, notices the initial selection missed a few pixels, and drags an editor crop handle outward to include the missing screen area.
  - A user prefers blue 5px arrows and larger text. They change the style once, close StepMark, and the next screenshot uses the same settings.
  - A user creates a smart note with the arrow extending left from the target shape. The text input appears on the left side and grows leftward while typing.

### Detailed Requirements

#### Bug Fixes

1. **Remove annotation shadow**
   - Smart note, rectangle, and arrow annotations must not render the current unwanted light-blue shadow/glow after creation.
   - Selection affordances may still exist, but they must be explicit handles or bounding controls, not a persistent decorative blue shadow on the annotation itself.

2. **Smart note left-side label behavior**
   - When the smart note arrow endpoint is left of the target shape centerline, the text input overlay appears to the left of the arrow endpoint.
   - While typing, the caret remains visually anchored and the text box expands leftward.
   - Long text should extend left by default in this case, instead of pushing the label rightward over the arrow or target shape.

3. **Smart note arrow start follows nearest boundary**
   - During smart note arrow preview, the arrow tail must continuously recompute from the shape boundary point nearest to the current mouse position.
   - The start point must not stay fixed at one corner after the target shape is drawn.
   - For rectangular smart notes, compute the nearest point on the rectangle perimeter.
   - For elliptical smart notes, compute the intersection point on the ellipse boundary in the direction from the ellipse center to the mouse position.

4. **Editor crop adjustment**
   - After entering the editor, users can resize the screenshot crop region by dragging any of the four edges or four corners.
   - The crop region can expand outward beyond the originally selected area, as long as it stays within the original full-screen capture bounds.
   - Crop adjustment should behave like Snipaste: direct manipulation handles on the current screenshot boundary, with immediate visual feedback.

#### New Requirements

1. **Persistent style settings**
   - Style settings must be saved locally and restored after closing and reopening StepMark.
   - Settings are per tool where behavior differs by tool.
   - Defaults must remain compatible with V0.1.0: red `#ff4757`, 3px stroke, system font.

2. **Toolbar secondary option panel**
   - Clicking a tool in the toolbar shows a small secondary panel below the toolbar.
   - The panel content depends on the active tool.
   - The panel should follow the Snipaste reference pattern provided by the user: compact controls for stroke width, fill/shape options where applicable, and color swatches.

3. **Tool-specific options**
   - Smart note:
     - Color.
     - Stroke width.
     - Shape: rectangle or ellipse.
     - Text font size.
     - Text font family.
   - Rectangle:
     - Color.
     - Stroke width.
     - Shape: rectangle or ellipse.
   - Arrow:
     - Color.
     - Stroke width.
     - Line style: solid or dashed.
     - Arrow head size.
   - Text:
     - Color.
     - Font size.
     - Font family.

### Input/Output

- **Input**:
  - Mouse drag on crop handles.
  - Toolbar tool selection.
  - Secondary panel style changes.
  - Keyboard or wheel input for numeric stroke width and font size, where supported.
  - Text input for font family selection or dropdown selection from available fonts.
- **Output**:
  - Updated editor preview.
  - Updated annotation style for newly created annotations.
  - Persisted local settings for future sessions.
  - Exported image reflects the current crop region and visible annotations.

### Edge Cases

- Crop region cannot be resized outside the original full-screen capture.
- Crop region must enforce a practical minimum size, such as 20x20 px.
- Annotations are positioned in full-screen coordinate space. If crop adjustment hides an annotation outside the crop, the annotation remains stored and is clipped by the visible canvas.
- Undo/redo should include crop-region changes.
- Existing annotations should keep their own styles after creation unless an explicit "apply to selected annotation" action exists. V0.2.0 only requires style settings to affect newly created annotations.
- If a saved font family is unavailable, fall back to system UI font without crashing.
- If style settings are corrupt or missing, use defaults.

## Design Decisions

### Technical Approach

- **Architecture Choice**: Keep the existing Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Konva + Zustand architecture. V0.2.0 should extend the editor model rather than replace it.
- **Full-screen source image**: The editor must retain the original full-screen capture, not only the initially cropped image. The current visible screenshot is a crop viewport over that full-screen source.
- **Coordinate model**: Store crop bounds and annotations in full-screen coordinate space. Rendering maps full-screen coordinates into the editor viewport by subtracting the current crop origin.
- **Style model**: Add a persistent style settings store, likely backed by localStorage or a Tauri-side settings file. Use a typed wrapper so corrupt persisted values can be validated and reset.
- **Toolbar option panel**: Add a reusable secondary panel component that renders controls based on the active tool and updates the persisted style store.

### Suggested Data Model Changes

```typescript
type ShapeKind = "rect" | "ellipse";
type LineStyle = "solid" | "dashed";

interface CropRegion {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

interface EditorState {
  sourceImage: string;       // full-screen capture base64
  cropRegion: CropRegion;   // visible crop in source-image coordinates
  annotations: Annotation[]; // coordinates are source-image coordinates
}

interface ToolStyleSettings {
  smart: {
    color: string;
    strokeWidth: number;
    shape: ShapeKind;
    fontSize: number;
    fontFamily: string;
  };
  rect: {
    color: string;
    strokeWidth: number;
    shape: ShapeKind;
  };
  arrow: {
    color: string;
    strokeWidth: number;
    lineStyle: LineStyle;
    arrowHeadSize: number;
  };
  text: {
    color: string;
    fontSize: number;
    fontFamily: string;
  };
}
```

### Constraints

- **Platform**: Windows x64 only.
- **Performance**: Crop handle dragging and arrow preview should remain visually smooth. Target: no visible lag during normal mouse movement on a 1080p display.
- **Compatibility**: Preserve V0.1.0 export behavior: PNG/JPG save and clipboard copy still export the visible crop with annotations.
- **Visual Quality**: Default style remains Snipaste-like: 3px stroke, `#ff4757`, system font.
- **Implementation Boundary**: Do not add a full settings page in V0.2.0 unless required by implementation. Use the toolbar secondary panel for this release.

### Risk Assessment

- **Crop coordinate migration risk**: Moving from cropped-image coordinates to full-screen coordinates can break annotation placement and export. Mitigation: add geometry tests and manual smoke tests for initial crop, expanded crop, shrunken crop, and exported output.
- **Konva rendering risk**: Crop clipping and shape transforms can produce off-by-one or blurry output. Mitigation: render the full-screen source with explicit crop offset and verify export pixels manually.
- **Text input overlay risk**: HTML input positioning over Konva can drift when crop origin changes. Mitigation: centralize coordinate conversion helpers and test left/right label placement.
- **Settings persistence risk**: Invalid saved values can break the toolbar. Mitigation: validate persisted settings and fallback to defaults.
